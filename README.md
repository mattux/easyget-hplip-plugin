# Easy-Get the Hplip Plugin

_Have you updated the hplip package?_

_The printer doesn't work anymore?_

Maybe the reason is that the *hplip* now is updated, but the *hplip's plugin* is not.

The _hp-plugin_ utility is able to download (and install) the new plugin's version, but sometimes fails. And you have to download it manually, that is annoying.


This little script downloads the correct version of the plugin. And then launch the _hp-plugin_ utility.


##### Important note:
- Works only on Fedora.
